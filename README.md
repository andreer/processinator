A very simple (but also messy) CPU I built in logisim-evolution: https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution

Features:
 - Entire one-level design fits on my screen
 - von Neumann architecture
 - 32-bit data path
 - 24-bit address space / 64 MB memory
 - tty output
 - all operations can be conditional (though most are useless!)
